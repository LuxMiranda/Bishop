        ## About
        
        Bishop, after [Washington Bishop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving_Bishop), is a cognitive model of [Theory of mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind).
        
        ## Install and uninstall
        
        	python setup.py install
        	pip uninstall Bishop
        
        ## Running Bishop
        
        #### Simulate agents traveling in an existing map
        
        	from Bishop import *	
        	Observer = LoadEnvironment("Tatik_T1_L1")
        	Observer.SimulateAgents(Samples=100,HumanReadable=True)
        
        To see a list of available maps just type
        	
        	ShowAvailableMaps()
        
        #### Cost-reward inference given observable actions
        
        	Observer = LoadEnvironment("Tatik_T1_L1")
        	Res = Observer.InferAgent(['L','L','U'], Samples=100, Feedback=True)
        
        The result is a __PosteriorContainer__ object. Here are some things you can do with the output
        
        	Res.Summary() # Human-readable summary
        	Res.AnalyzeConvergence() # Visually check if sampling converged
        	Res.PlotCostPosterior()
        	Res.PlotRewardPosterior()
        	Res.Summary(Human=False) # prints summary in csv style for easier analysis
        	SaveSamples(Res, "MyResults")
        
        You can reload the samples and the observer model later with
        
        	Res = LoadSamples("MyResults.p")
        	Observer = LoadObserver(Res)
        
        ## Creating a new map
        
        ### Through configuration files
        
        A map consists of two files: An ASCII description, and a .ini configuration file.
        
        ASCII files begin with a map drawing, with each terrain type indicated numerically. After a line break, each terrain name is specified in a single line
        
        	000
        	111
        	000
        	
        	Jungle
        	Water
        
        specifies a 3x3 map where the top and bottom row are "Jungle" and the middle row is "Water."
        
        The second file, MapName.ini, lets you specify properties of the agent (e.g., is the agent strictly or approximately rational and efficient?) and the map (starting point and exit states). See the Maps folder for an example.
        
        ### Inside python
        
        ##### Map skeleton
        
        To generate a simple grid-world with one terrain start with
        
        	MyMap = Map()
        	MyMap.BuildGridWorld(5,3,Diagonal=True)
        
        This creates a 5 by 3 map that can be navigated diagonally. Terrain type is stored in MyMap.StateTypes. The first terrain has by default a value of 0. New terrains are added through squares:
        
        	MyMap.InsertSquare(2, 1, 2, 3, 1):
        
        added a 2x3 square with the top-left corner positioned on (2,1). Both coordinates begin in 1 and the y-axis is counted from top to bottom. The last argument (1) gives the terrain code. Inserting overlapping squares always rewrites past terrain. You can then add terrain names
        
        	MyMap.AddStateNames(["Water","Jungle"])
        
        To see what your map looks like type
        
        	MyMap.PrintMap()
        
        ##### Adding targets
        
        SOON
        
        ##### Saving the map
        
        SOON
        
        ##### Using the map
        
        Once you have a map, you need to create an agent, and use both to create an observer
        
        	MyAgent = Agent(MyMap, CostParam, RewardParam)
        	Observer = Observer(MyMap, MyAgent)
